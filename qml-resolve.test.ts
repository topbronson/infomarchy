// qml-syntax.test.ts proves each file PARSES. That is a weaker guarantee than
// it looks: a property bound to an id that does not exist is perfectly valid
// syntax and still fails on the desk. Verified — injecting
// `nonexistentThing.value` into InfoSettings produced zero syntax findings.
//
// This gate resolves the real imports instead (`qs.Commons`, `qs.Ui` and the
// Quickshell modules) so qmllint can tell whether a name actually exists.
//
// It gates on a per-file CEILING rather than zero, because the codebase carries
// hundreds of findings that are idiomatic or unmodellable rather than wrong:
// `[unqualified]` is how QML reads its own root properties, `PanelWindow` is
// created by the Quickshell runtime so qmllint calls it uncreatable, and
// BackgroundWallpaper.qml deliberately names `BackgroundMedia`, which only
// exists on an Omarchy with video wallpaper support — that file is loaded by
// URL precisely so its absence stays survivable.
//
// A ceiling still catches the case that matters: one new unresolvable
// reference moves the count, which is exactly what a bad merge introduces.
// Verified — the same injection took InfoModel from 5 to 6.

// against a ceiling of 26 and failed every stock install. Each one is the
// fallback working as designed, not a defect:
//   - `Util.isVideoPath` is only called behind `typeof ... === "function"`.

//     cannot take the plugin down; with it unresolved, that file's `qs.Ui`
